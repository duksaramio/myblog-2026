                <h1>Health Must Be Your Top Priority</h1>
                
                <p>I’ve come to a realization: you cannot perform at the top level with bad health. We often like to believe that our intellect is independent of our physical state—that the brain can somehow work its magic regardless of what’s happening below the neck. But I’m starting to doubt that’s true.</p>

                <p>When I talk about "bad health," I’m using it as a broad term. Whether it’s being overweight, obese, or just generally out of shape, these physical states have a profound impact on cognitive performance. The brain isn't the miracle we often think it is; it’s a biological system, and like any system, it follows the "garbage in, garbage out" principle.</p>

                <p>Take sleep, for example. When I don’t sleep well, my day starts with a lingering headache, followed by a specific kind of hunger. It’s not the normal hunger that goes away after a meal. It’s a persistent, gnawing craving that stems from a confused brain. Science tells us that sleep deprivation messes with the hormones that regulate hunger, and I’ve felt that confusion firsthand. Eating doesn't solve it because the problem isn't caloric; it's systemic.</p>

                <p>It’s frustrating to realize that I might be living my life at a sub-optimal level at all times. If my physical health is compromised, my mental clarity is compromised. If I’m not refueling and resting properly, I’m essentially trading my future performance for a temporary, low-quality present.</p>

                <p>So, I’m making a change. I will try to lose weight for real this time. Not just for the sake of the scale, but because I want to see what my brain is actually capable of when it's not being held back by a physical state I’ve neglected. Health isn't just a separate goal—it's the foundation for everything else.</p>
