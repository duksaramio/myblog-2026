                <h1>Make Problem Simpler</h1>

                <p>When a problem arises, our instinct is often to scramble for a complex solution. We zero in on the
                    fix, sometimes overlooking the possibility of changing the problem itself.</p>

                <p>For a long time, I struggled with a minor but persistent annoyance: losing my place in a physical
                    book. I'd pause reading, and when I returned, I'd often find myself on the wrong line, only
                    realizing after a few paragraphs that I'd already read that section.</p>

                <p>I turned to Gemini for ideas. It suggested all sorts of interesting bookmarks and systems—solutions
                    that would definitely work. But then it hit me: <strong>"Why don't I just allow myself to always
                        finish the entire page before stopping?"</strong> It rarely takes more than a minute to reach
                    the end of a page.</p>

                <p>When we face a challenge, the first question we should ask isn't just "How do I solve this?" but "Is
                    this problem rigid or malleable?" Can we make the problem slightly easier to solve by shifting our
                    own habits or constraints?</p>

                <p>Interestingly, while Gemini offered many clever tools, it never suggested the simplest change of all:
                    making it a habit to read to the bottom of the page so I always know the next page is fresh ground.
                    Sometimes the best solution isn't a new tool, but a simpler problem.</p>
