                <h1>How to Make Money using vibe Coding</h1>
                
                <p>In the current gold rush of artificial intelligence, it seems like everyone and their neighbor is trying to build the next "unicorn" AI SaaS company. While the ambition is admirable, the reality is that the landscape is becoming incredibly crowded and risky. If you're building something that a big AI player can replicate in a single weekend update, your business model is on borrowed time.</p>

                <p>Instead of competing with the giants, I believe the real opportunity for sustainable success lies in <strong>targeting niche markets</strong>. Believe it or not, there are countless industries where the potential profit isn't massive enough for big AI companies to care, but it's more than enough for an individual or a small team to thrive.</p>

                <h2>The Niche Opportunity</h2>
                <p>Generally speaking, software in niche markets is surprisingly bad—and often quite expensive. These industries have been neglected by modern tech because they aren't "sexy" or "scalable" enough for venture capital. This is where you can win.</p>
                <p>By applying "vibe coding"—using AI tools to rapidly build and iterate on solutions—you can enter these markets with minimal overhead. The key is to partner with someone who has deep domain knowledge, or better yet, use your own if you have it. You don't need to rebuild Salesforce; you just need to solve one specific, painful problem for a specific group of people.</p>

                <h2>A Sustainable Path</h2>
                <p>You might not become a billion-dollar company by building a specialized tool for HVAC contractors or niche logistics firms. However, you can absolutely make a decent living—even a very comfortable one—doing this today. In a world of over-hyped AI startups, being a profitable "niche king" is a much better vibe.</p>
